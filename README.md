Replicating-DeepMind
====================

Reproducing the results of "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by DeepMind. All the information is in our [Wiki](https://github.com/kristjankorjus/Replicating-DeepMind/wiki).

Progress: 'smart' agent is playing, chooses an action based on a randomly initalised neural network.

Alert! The system is not fully ready! At the moment we are re-implementing the neural network using cuda-convnet2. Hopefully everything will be functional by December.
